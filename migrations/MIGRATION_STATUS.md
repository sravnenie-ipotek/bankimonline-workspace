# Content Migration Status

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Translation Key Restoration ✅
- Reverted the `__MIGRATED_` prefix from all translation keys
- All pages should now display correctly with proper translations
- English: 341 keys restored
- Hebrew: 343 keys restored  
- Russian: 329 keys restored

### 2. Migration Scripts Created ✅
- `migrate_four_pages_content.sql` - Main content migration
- `migrate_additional_page_content.sql` - Additional content from JSON files
- `comment_migrated_translations.js` - Script to prefix keys with __MIGRATED_ (for future use)
- `revert_migrated_translations.js` - Script to restore original keys

### 3. Content Analysis Completed ✅
- Analyzed all 4 pages for content migration:
  - `/cooperation` - Partner program page
  - `/tenders-for-brokers` - Broker licensing page
  - `/Real-Estate-Brokerage` - Franchise page (uses TemporaryFranchise component)
  - `/tenders-for-lawyers` - Legal partnership page

## Current Status

### Working State
- All translation keys are active and pages display correctly
- No missing translations detected
- All components still use direct `t()` calls from JSON files

### Database Migration (Pending)
The SQL migration scripts are ready but NOT YET EXECUTED. To migrate content to the database:

```bash
# Run main migration
psql $DATABASE_URL < migrations/migrate_four_pages_content.sql

# Run additional content migration
psql $DATABASE_URL < migrations/migrate_additional_page_content.sql
```

### Component Updates (Pending)
After database migration, update these components to use `useContentApi`:

1. **Cooperation.tsx** - Currently uses `t()` directly
2. **TendersForBrokers.tsx** - Currently uses `t()` directly
3. **TendersForLawyers.tsx** - Currently uses `t()` directly
4. **TemporaryFranchise.tsx** - Already uses `useContentApi` ✅

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1 (Current) ✅
- Keep JSON translations active
- Prepare database migration scripts
- Test pages work correctly

### Phase 2 (Next Steps)
1. Run SQL migrations to populate database
2. Update components one by one to use `useContentApi`
3. Test each component after update
4. Once all components are updated and tested, run `comment_migrated_translations.js` to disable JSON keys

### Phase 3 (Final)
- All content served from database
- JSON files only contain keys not migrated to database
- Full content management system operational

## Important Notes

1. The TemporaryFranchise component already uses `useContentApi` and will automatically use database content once migrated
2. All dropdown/accordion items are properly categorized as `component_type = 'option'` in the migration
3. Professional lawyer-level translations are maintained in all languages
4. The migration follows all specified rules including sequential numbering for options

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check if translations are working
grep "lawyers_hero_title" mainapp/public/locales/en/translation.json

# Check server logs for errors
tail -f server.log

# Test database connection
node test-railway-simple.js
