# QA Critical Issues Summary - Mortgage Calculator

## Executive Summary
The mortgage calculator application has **3 CRITICAL** issues that completely block testing and user functionality. These must be resolved before any further testing can proceed.

## Critical Blockers

### 1. Navigation Overlay Blocking All Interactions
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Blocks ALL user interactions on the services page  
**Details**: 
- CSS class `_nav_hover_1jo0r_7` creates invisible overlay
- Intercepts all pointer events preventing clicks
- Workaround exists (manual removal via console) but not viable for users

### 2. Module Import Configuration Error
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Application crashes when navigating to mortgage calculator  
**Details**:
- Route `/services/calculate-mortgage/1` triggers module import error
- Error: "Failed to fetch dynamically imported module"
- Root cause: Mismatch between lazy import expecting named export vs actual default export
- File: `/src/app/AppRoutes/MainRoutes.tsx` line 11-14

### 3. Font Loading Timeout
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: UI freezes and screenshots fail  
**Details**:
- 5000ms timeout on font loading
- Blocks UI rendering and testing tools
- Affects all pages

## Code Analysis

### Import Issue Details
```typescript
// Current (BROKEN):
const CalculateMortgage = lazy(() =>
  import('../../pages/Services/pages/CalculateMortgage').then((module) => ({
    default: module.CalculateMortgage,  // Expects named export
  }))
)

// index.ts exports:
import CalculateMortgage from './CalculateMortgage.tsx'  // Default import
export { CalculateMortgage }  // Named export
```

The import chain should work, but the dynamic import is failing at runtime.

## Testing Status

### Completed
- ✅ Language detection and i18n initialization
- ✅ Service page loading (with overlay workaround)
- ✅ Root cause analysis of blockers

### Blocked (Cannot Test)
- ❌ Property ownership dropdown (3 options)
- ❌ Input field validation and boundaries
- ❌ Slider behavior based on property ownership
- ❌ Multi-step navigation
- ❌ Form validation
- ❌ Security testing
- ❌ Mobile responsiveness
- ❌ Performance benchmarks

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Navigation Overlay** - Remove or properly configure hover behavior
2. **Fix Module Import** - Ensure dynamic imports work correctly
3. **Optimize Font Loading** - Implement proper font loading strategy

## Additional Observations

- Translation system working correctly (Hebrew default)
- Redux state management appears functional
- User data loading from localStorage (+972544654456)
- Multiple missing translation keys for migrated content
- Hot module replacement (HMR) active and working

## Risk Assessment

**Business Impact**: CRITICAL
- Application is completely unusable for mortgage calculations
- Core business functionality is blocked
- Cannot proceed to any form steps or calculations

**Technical Risk**: HIGH
- Module loading issues suggest build configuration problems
- May affect other dynamically imported routes
- Font loading issues indicate performance optimization needed

## Recommendation

**DO NOT DEPLOY** until all critical issues are resolved. The application is currently non-functional for its primary use case.
