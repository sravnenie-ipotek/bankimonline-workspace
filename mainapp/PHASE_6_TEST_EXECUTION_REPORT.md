### 2. Feature Flag Validation Tests
**File**: `verify_phase6_feature_flags.cy.ts`
**Total Tests**: 14
**Passed**: 0
**Failed**: 14 (all skipped due to missing endpoints)

#### Missing Infrastructure:
- `/api/admin/feature-flags/reset` - 404 Not Found
- `/api/v1/params/feature-flags` - Not implemented
- `/api/admin/metrics` - Not available
- Emergency kill switch endpoints - Missing

### 3. Rollback Tests
**File**: `verify_phase6_rollback.cy.ts`
**Status**: Not executed (similar infrastructure requirements)

## Phase 6 Requirements Analysis

### ✅ What's Working:
1. **Basic Application Functionality**
   - Mortgage calculator loads
   - Forms are functional
   - API endpoints for core features work

2. **Database Backups**
   - Backup files exist in `@28.07.25/` directory
   - Multiple backup snapshots available

3. **Migration Scripts**
   - Phase 1 migration files present
   - SQL files properly structured

### ❌ What's Missing:

1. **Feature Flag System**
   - No feature flag infrastructure
   - `USE_DB_DROPDOWNS` flag not implemented
   - No gradual rollout capability
   - No A/B testing framework

2. **Database Tables**
   - `content_items` table not created
   - `content_translations` table missing
   - Required indexes not implemented

3. **Deployment Infrastructure**
   - No health check endpoints
   - No monitoring/metrics collection
   - No audit logging
   - No emergency controls

4. **Admin APIs**
   - Feature flag management endpoints
   - Metrics and monitoring endpoints
   - Rollback control endpoints

## Root Cause Analysis

The Phase 6 tests are failing because:

1. **Phase 6 has not been implemented** - The tests expect infrastructure that doesn't exist
2. **Database migrations not run** - The content management tables haven't been created
3. **Feature flag system not built** - No backend support for feature flags
4. **Admin endpoints missing** - The admin API layer for deployment control doesn't exist

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Skip Phase 6** - This phase requires significant infrastructure development
2. **Focus on Phase 5** - Complete the existing functionality testing
3. **Document gaps** - Note what would need to be built for Phase 6

### If Phase 6 Implementation is Required:

1. **Database Setup**:
   ```sql
   -- Run migration scripts
   migrations/202501_phase1_screen_location_alignment.sql
   migrations/202501_phase1_2_component_type_refactor.sql
   migrations/202501_phase1_3_categories_and_indexes.sql
   ```

2. **Feature Flag Backend**:
   - Implement `/api/admin/feature-flags` endpoints
   - Add feature flag storage in database
   - Build rollout percentage logic

3. **Monitoring Infrastructure**:
   - Create `/api/health` endpoint
   - Implement metrics collection
   - Add audit logging

4. **Admin Interface**:
   - Build feature flag UI
   - Add deployment controls
   - Implement rollback mechanisms

## Test Artifacts

### Successful Tests:
- File existence checks ✅
- Basic API responsiveness ✅
- Frontend loading ✅

### Failed Test Examples:
```javascript
// Expected but missing:
cy.task('queryDb', 'SELECT * FROM content_items')
// Error: relation "content_items" does not exist

cy.request('POST', '/api/admin/feature-flags')
// Error: 404 Not Found

cy.request('/api/health')
// Error: Cannot GET /api/health
```

## Conclusion

Phase 6 represents advanced deployment and rollback capabilities that have not been implemented in the current system. The tests are well-written and comprehensive, but they expect infrastructure that doesn't exist.

**Current State**: The application works with the existing dropdown system from translation files. The database-driven dropdown system and its deployment infrastructure (Phase 6) have not been built.

**Recommendation**: Continue using the current working system. Phase 6 implementation would require significant development effort including:
- Database schema changes
- Backend API development
- Feature flag system
- Monitoring infrastructure
- Admin interface

The Phase 6 tests serve as a specification for what would need to be built, but the current application functions correctly without these advanced features.
