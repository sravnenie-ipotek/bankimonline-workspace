# Phase 5 E2E Test Execution Report

## Executive Summary
- **Date**: July 31, 2025
- **Phase**: Phase 5 - Validation & Testing
- **Status**: FAILED ❌
- **Tests Run**: 15
- **Tests Passed**: 0
- **Tests Failed**: 6
- **Tests Skipped**: 9

## Test Environment
- **Frontend Server**: ✅ Running on http://localhost:5173
- **Backend Server**: ✅ Running on http://localhost:8003
- **API Health Check**: ✅ Operational
- **Dropdown API**: ✅ Responding correctly

## Test Results Summary

### 1. Mortgage Calculator Happy Path
**Status**: FAILED ❌

#### Failures by Language:
1. **English (EN)**: Failed to find property-ownership-dropdown element
2. **Hebrew (HE)**: Failed to find property-ownership-dropdown element  
3. **Russian (RU)**: Failed to find property-ownership-dropdown element

#### Root Cause Analysis:
- **Issue**: Page shows "הדף המבוקש לא נמצא" (Page not found) 
- **Diagnosis**: The test is navigating to the wrong URL or there's a routing issue
- **Evidence**: Screenshots show 404 page instead of mortgage calculator

### 2. Cross-Language Consistency
**Status**: FAILED ❌
- Unable to test due to page not loading

### 3. API Integration Tests
**Status**: FAILED ❌
- API calls not intercepted because page didn't load
- Dropdown endpoints are working correctly when tested directly

### 4. Cache Validation
**Status**: FAILED ❌
- Could not test cache behavior due to page loading issues

## Technical Findings

### API Validation
```json
// API Response (Working Correctly)
{
  "status": "success",
  "screen_location": "mortgage_step1",
  "language_code": "en",
  "dropdowns": [
    {
      "key": "mortgage_step1_city",
      "label": "City"
    },
    {
      "key": "mortgage_step1_first",
      "label": "Is this your first apartment?"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Server Status
- Backend API: ✅ Healthy
- Frontend Dev Server: ✅ Running
- Database Connection: ✅ Connected
- CORS: ✅ Enabled

## Issues Identified

### 1. Navigation/Routing Issue
- **Problem**: Tests cannot navigate to `/services/calculate-mortgage`
- **Impact**: All E2E tests fail at the first step
- **Possible Causes**:
  - URL mismatch between test and actual application
  - Language routing issues (RTL default)
  - Missing route configuration

### 2. Element Selectors
- **Problem**: `[data-testid="property-ownership-dropdown"]` not found
- **Impact**: Cannot interact with form elements
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Elements not rendered due to page not loading
  - Incorrect data-testid attributes
  - Component not using database dropdowns

### 3. Test Configuration
- **Problem**: Tests expect immediate element availability
- **Impact**: No graceful handling of loading states
- **Recommendation**: Add proper wait conditions

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Fix Navigation Issue**
   - Verify correct URL for mortgage calculator
   - Check if language prefix is needed (e.g., `/en/services/calculate-mortgage`)
   - Ensure routing works in test environment

2. **Update Test Selectors**
   - Audit actual data-testid attributes in components
   - Add missing test IDs to form elements
   - Verify component integration with database dropdowns

3. **Improve Test Resilience**
   - Add explicit waits for page load
   - Implement better error handling
   - Add debug logging for troubleshooting

### Code Fixes Needed:
```javascript
// Current (Failing)
cy.visit('/services/calculate-mortgage');

// Recommended
cy.visit('/services/calculate-mortgage');
cy.url().should('include', '/services/calculate-mortgage');
cy.contains('Mortgage Calculator').should('be.visible');
```

## Test Artifacts
- **Screenshots**: 15 screenshots captured showing 404 pages
- **Video**: Full test execution recorded
- **Location**: `/cypress/screenshots/run-2025-07-31T09-04-50/`

## Conclusion
Phase 5 E2E tests are currently non-functional due to navigation/routing issues. The underlying dropdown migration appears to be working correctly based on API validation, but the E2E tests cannot verify the user-facing functionality until the routing issue is resolved.

## Next Steps
1. Debug and fix the routing issue
2. Update test selectors to match actual components
3. Re-run tests with fixes applied
4. Update this report with new results

## Test Execution Command
```bash
cd mainapp && npm run cypress:run -- --spec "cypress/e2e/phase_5_e2e/mortgage_calculator_happy_path.cy.ts"
