1. Start your development server:
  # In a new terminal window, navigate to your project root:
  cd /Users/michaelmishayev/Projects/bankDev2_standalone

  # Start the development server:
  npm run dev
  # OR
  cd mainapp && npm run dev

  2. Once the server is running, run the test again:
  # In the browserstack directory:
  node test.js

  3. View results on BrowserStack:
  - Go to: https://automate.browserstack.com/
  - Login with: qabankimonline@gmail.com
  - Look for build: "E2E-BankimOnline-Calculator"
  - Even the failed test run should show up in your dashboard!

  The test is now ready to work - you just need your local development server running
  on port 5173! ðŸš€
