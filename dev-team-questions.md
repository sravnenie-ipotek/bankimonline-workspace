# üìã **DEV TEAM QUESTIONS: CONTENT DATABASE ANALYSIS**

## **Context: Content Management System Review**

Following the recent dropdown fixes and content system integration, we need to conduct a comprehensive analysis of our content database structure to identify optimization opportunities and potential technical debt.

---

## **üîç IMMEDIATE ANALYSIS QUESTIONS**

### **1. Data Analysis & Distribution**

**Question:** Can we run a comprehensive query to analyze content distribution across all steps?

```sql
-- Proposed Analysis Query
SELECT 
  screen_location,
  component_type,
  COUNT(*) as item_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT content_key) as unique_keys,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 1) as percentage_of_total
FROM content_items 
WHERE screen_location LIKE '%step%'
GROUP BY screen_location, component_type
ORDER BY screen_location, component_type;
```

**Expected Deliverable:** 
- Content distribution heat map per step
- Identification of steps with unusually high content counts
- Component type distribution analysis

---

### **2. Duplicate Content Detection**

**Question:** Are there content_keys that appear multiple times across different screens with similar component_types?

```sql
-- Proposed Duplicate Detection Query
SELECT 
  content_key,
  COUNT(*) as occurrences,
  array_agg(DISTINCT screen_location) as screens,
  array_agg(DISTINCT component_type) as component_types,
  CASE 
    WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT component_type) = 1 THEN 'Same Type'
    ELSE 'Mixed Types'
  END as duplication_type
FROM content_items 
GROUP BY content_key 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

**Key Questions:**
- Are duplicates intentional (legitimate reuse) or technical debt?
- Should shared content use a different architecture (e.g., global content refs)?
- What's the business impact of content inconsistencies across screens?

---

### **3. Context Distribution Analysis**

**Question:** How are content items distributed across the 4 main application contexts?

**Proposed Context Categories:**
- **Customer-Facing:** `mortgage_step*`, `credit_step*`, `refinance_step*`
- **User Portal:** `other_borrowers_*`, `borrowers_personal_data_*`
- **CMS/Admin:** `admin_*`, `cms_*`
- **Bank Operations:** `bank_*`, `worker_*`

```sql
-- Context Distribution Query
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN screen_location LIKE 'mortgage_step%' OR screen_location LIKE 'credit_step%' OR screen_location LIKE 'refinance_step%' THEN 'customer_facing'
    WHEN screen_location LIKE 'other_%' OR screen_location LIKE 'borrowers_%' THEN 'user_portal'
    WHEN screen_location LIKE 'admin_%' OR screen_location LIKE 'cms_%' THEN 'cms_admin'
    WHEN screen_location LIKE 'bank_%' OR screen_location LIKE 'worker_%' THEN 'bank_ops'
    ELSE 'other'
  END as context,
  COUNT(*) as item_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT content_key) as unique_keys
FROM content_items 
GROUP BY context
ORDER BY item_count DESC;
```

**Analysis Goals:**
- Understand content complexity per application area
- Identify potential context-specific optimization opportunities
- Plan context-aware caching strategies

---

### **4. Translation Coverage & Quality**

**Question:** What's our translation coverage across all content items and languages?

```sql
-- Translation Coverage Analysis
SELECT 
  ci.screen_location,
  COUNT(ci.id) as total_items,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN ct_en.content_item_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as english_translations,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN ct_he.content_item_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as hebrew_translations,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN ct_ru.content_item_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as russian_translations,
  ROUND(
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ct_en.content_item_id IS NOT NULL AND ct_he.content_item_id IS NOT NULL AND ct_ru.content_item_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(ci.id), 
    1
  ) as complete_coverage_percent
FROM content_items ci
LEFT JOIN content_translations ct_en ON ci.id = ct_en.content_item_id AND ct_en.language_code = 'en'
LEFT JOIN content_translations ct_he ON ci.id = ct_he.content_item_id AND ct_he.language_code = 'he'
LEFT JOIN content_translations ct_ru ON ci.id = ct_ru.content_item_id AND ct_ru.language_code = 'ru'
GROUP BY ci.screen_location
ORDER BY complete_coverage_percent ASC;
```

**Critical Questions:**
- Which screens have incomplete translations?
- Should we implement automated translation validation?
- What's the impact of missing translations on user experience?

---

## **üõ†Ô∏è CLEANUP & OPTIMIZATION QUESTIONS**

### **5. Content Deduplication Strategy**

**Question:** Should we implement a content deduplication script or is the current duplication expected?

**Proposed Deduplication Categories:**
- **Global Content:** Error messages, common buttons, validation text
- **Shared Dropdowns:** Professional fields, cities, banks
- **Screen-Specific:** Step titles, instructions, help text

**Implementation Options:**
1. **Reference System:** Create `global_content` table with references
2. **Inheritance System:** Parent-child content relationships
3. **Template System:** Content templates with variable substitution
4. **Current System:** Accept duplication for simplicity

**Decision Factors:**
- Maintenance overhead vs. simplicity
- Translation management complexity
- Performance implications
- Development team preferences

---

### **6. Performance & Architecture**

**Question:** Are 20+ content items per mortgage step a performance concern or acceptable business requirement?

**Performance Analysis Needed:**
- Database query performance for high-content screens
- API response sizes and caching effectiveness
- Frontend rendering performance with large option sets
- Memory usage in production

**Business Justification Analysis:**
- Are all content items actively used by components?
- Do certain screens require extensive customization?
- Is content granularity driven by CMS requirements?

---

### **7. Content Key Pattern Standardization**

**Question:** Should we standardize content key patterns for better maintainability?

**Current Patterns Observed:**
- `app.service.step.field` (hierarchical)
- `screen_field_format` (flat)
- `error_field_validation` (categorical)

**Proposed Standard:**
```
{context}.{service}.{step}.{component_type}.{field_name}
Examples:
- customer.mortgage.step1.dropdown.property_ownership
- customer.mortgage.step1.placeholder.property_ownership
- customer.mortgage.step1.validation.property_ownership
```

## **üìä TECHNICAL DEBT ASSESSMENT**

### **8. Legacy Content Migration**

**Question:** How much content is still being migrated from JSON files vs. database-native?

**Migration Status Check:**
- Identify commented-out keys in translation.json files
- Compare database content coverage vs. frontend component usage
- Assess migration completion percentage by screen

### **9. Component-Database Mapping**

**Question:** Are there frontend components expecting content that doesn't exist in the database?

**Validation Strategy:**
- Automated scanning of component translation calls
- Database content availability verification
- Missing content identification and prioritization
