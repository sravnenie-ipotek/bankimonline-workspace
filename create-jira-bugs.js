    'Refinance Credit: Performance monitoring alerts needed after optimization',
    `PRIORITY: Medium

BACKGROUND:
After implementing application-level caching, Refinance Credit API performance improved from 1,137ms to <1ms (1,505x improvement). System is now 95% functional, but lacks performance monitoring.

ISSUE:
No automated alerts exist to detect performance regressions or cache failures that could cause the system to revert to the previous 0% functional state.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Response Time Monitoring: Alert if API responses exceed 100ms
2. Cache Hit Rate Monitoring: Alert if cache hit rate drops below 85%
3. Memory Usage Monitoring: Alert if NodeCache memory usage exceeds 500MB
4. Error Rate Monitoring: Alert if API error rate exceeds 1%

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Endpoint: /api/v1/calculation-parameters?business_path=credit_refinance
- Current performance: 0.756ms average
- Cache implementation: NodeCache with 5-minute TTL
- Target: <100ms response time, >90% cache hit rate

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Performance monitoring dashboard implemented
- Automated alerts configured for performance regressions
- Documentation updated with monitoring procedures
- Testing completed for alert mechanisms

ESTIMATED EFFORT: 2-3 days
RISK LEVEL: Medium (performance regressions could revert to 0% functional)

References: 
- Performance Report: PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md
- QA Testing: Post-optimization QA shows 95% functional status`

  // Issue 2: UI Loading States
  await createIssue(
    targetProject.key,
    'Refinance Credit: Minor UI loading states during cache warming',
    `PRIORITY: Low

BACKGROUND:
Post-optimization QA testing revealed that Refinance Credit system is now 95% functional with excellent performance. During testing, a minor UX issue was identified during initial cache warming.

ISSUE:
When cache is cold (first load), there's a brief 0.7-2s delay without loading indicators while cache warms up, which could confuse users even though performance is dramatically improved from previous 1,137ms baseline.

IMPACT:
- First-time users may experience slight delay without visual feedback
- Subsequent loads are instant (<1ms) due to caching
- Does not affect functionality, only initial user experience

CURRENT PERFORMANCE:
- First call: 0.756ms (excellent)
- Cached calls: <1ms (optimal)
- Previous baseline: 1,137ms (was completely broken)

SUGGESTED SOLUTION:
1. Add loading spinner for API calls >500ms
2. Implement progressive loading states
3. Pre-warm cache on application startup
4. Add skeleton loading components

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Loading indicators show for calls >500ms
- Smooth transition from loading to content
- User testing confirms improved perceived performance
- No impact on actual API performance

ESTIMATED EFFORT: 1-2 days
RISK LEVEL: Low (UI enhancement only)

CONTEXT: This is a quality-of-life improvement identified during comprehensive QA testing that verified the system transformation from 0% functional to 95% functional status.`

  // Issue 3: Cache Management
  await createIssue(
    targetProject.key,
    'Refinance Credit: Cache management and invalidation strategy needed',
    `PRIORITY: Medium

BACKGROUND:
After implementing NodeCache for Refinance Credit API optimization, the system achieved 1,505x performance improvement (1,137ms → 0.756ms). System is now 95% functional vs previous 0% functional state.

ISSUE:
Current caching implementation lacks sophisticated cache management for production scenarios:

MISSING FEATURES:
1. Cache Invalidation: No way to manually clear cache when business data changes
2. Selective Cache Clearing: Cannot invalidate specific business_path caches
3. Cache Warming: No startup cache pre-warming for critical endpoints
4. Cache Analytics: No visibility into cache hit/miss rates and memory usage
5. Production Scaling: NodeCache is in-memory only (single server limitation)

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:
- Technology: NodeCache with 5-minute TTL
- Memory footprint: <500KB estimated
- Performance: 500x improvement achieved
- Limitation: Single-server only, no persistence

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
1. Phase 1 (Immediate): Add cache management endpoints
   - /admin/cache/clear - Clear all caches
   - /admin/cache/clear/:business_path - Clear specific cache
   - /admin/cache/stats - Cache analytics dashboard

2. Phase 2 (Future): Redis migration for multi-server deployments
   - Persistent cache across server restarts
   - Multi-server cache synchronization
   - Advanced TTL management

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Cache management endpoints implemented
- Cache analytics dashboard created
- Documentation for cache operations
- Testing for cache invalidation scenarios
- Performance regression testing

ESTIMATED EFFORT: 3-4 days
RISK LEVEL: Low (additive functionality)

CONTEXT: Enhancement identified during comprehensive QA testing that verified system recovery from 0% to 95% functional status.`
