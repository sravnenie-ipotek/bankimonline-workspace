# 🔧 Hebrew Translation Corrector Guide

## ✅ **What It Does**

The Hebrew Translation Corrector analyzes your Hebrew translations in the content database and uses Azure Translator API to suggest corrections. It shows you 20 translations at a time and lets you approve or deny each suggestion.

## 🎯 **Key Features**

- ✅ **Batch Processing**: Shows 20 translations at a time
- ✅ **Azure API Integration**: Uses professional Azure Translator for suggestions
- ✅ **Interactive Approval**: Approve, deny, or skip each translation
- ✅ **Smart Analysis**: Only suggests corrections when needed (similarity < 80%)
- ✅ **Database Updates**: Directly updates your content database
- ✅ **Statistics Tracking**: Shows approval rates and processing stats
- ✅ **Safety Features**: Timeouts and error handling

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **Basic Usage**
```bash
# Process 20 translations at a time (default)
node scripts/hebrew-translation-corrector.js

# Process custom batch size
node scripts/hebrew-translation-corrector.js 10
```

### **What You'll See**
For each translation, you'll see:
- **Content Key**: The translation identifier
- **Screen Location**: Where it's used in the app
- **English Text**: The original English text
- **Current Hebrew**: Your current Hebrew translation
- **Azure Suggestion**: What Azure Translator suggests
- **Similarity**: How similar your translation is to Azure's (percentage)
- **Issues**: Any problems detected (if any)

### **Your Options for Each Translation**
```
🤔 Do you want to update this translation?
   (y)es - Use Azure suggestion
   (n)o - Keep current translation
   (s)kip - Skip this translation
   (q)uit - Stop processing
```

## 📊 **How It Works**

### **1. Analysis Process**
1. **Fetches** Hebrew translations from your database
2. **Compares** with Azure Translator API suggestions
3. **Calculates** similarity percentage
4. **Identifies** issues (too short, no Hebrew chars, etc.)
5. **Suggests** corrections only when needed

### **2. Correction Criteria**
- **Similarity < 80%**: Suggests correction
- **Very short text**: Suggests correction
- **No Hebrew characters**: Suggests correction
- **Too long/short**: Suggests correction

### **3. Safety Features**
- **60-second timeout** per translation decision
- **30-second timeout** for batch continuation
- **Rate limiting** (1 second between API calls)
- **Error handling** for API failures
- **Database transaction safety**
