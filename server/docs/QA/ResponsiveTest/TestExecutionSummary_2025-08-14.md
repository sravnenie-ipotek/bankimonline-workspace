## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

#### Development Servers Not Running
```bash
# Fix: Ensure both servers are active
npm run dev  # Backend (port 8003)
cd mainapp && npm run dev  # Frontend (port 5173)
```

#### Test Timeouts
```bash
# Fix: Increase timeout in cypress.config.ts
defaultCommandTimeout: 10000
responseTimeout: 30000
```

#### Screenshot Failures
```bash
# Fix: Ensure screenshot directory exists
mkdir -p cypress/screenshots/responsive
```

#### Mobile Menu Tests Failing
```bash
# Check: Ensure mobile viewport detection works
# The tests include fallback selectors for mobile menu triggers
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Parallel execution:** Can run multiple test files simultaneously
- **Headless mode:** Use `--headless` flag for faster execution
- **Video recording:** Disable with `--config video=false` for speed

## üìã MAINTENANCE RECOMMENDATIONS

### Regular Testing Schedule
- **Weekly:** Run abbreviated test suite (key viewports only)
- **Before releases:** Full comprehensive test suite execution
- **After UI changes:** Targeted responsive testing for affected components

### Test Suite Updates
- **New pages:** Add to the `pages` array in the test file
- **New viewports:** Add to the `viewports` array as needed
- **New languages:** Add to the `languages` array for multi-language support

### Monitoring Integration
Consider integrating with CI/CD pipeline:
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions snippet
- name: Run Responsive Tests
  run: |
    npm run dev &
    cd mainapp && npm run dev &
    wait-on http://localhost:8003 http://localhost:5173
    npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/comprehensive-responsive-test-suite.cy.ts"
```
