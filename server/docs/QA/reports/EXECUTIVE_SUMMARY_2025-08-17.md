## ‚úÖ RESOLVED ISSUES (From Earlier Today)

### What Was Fixed:
1. **Dropdown Data Missing** ‚Üí Now all dropdowns have correct options
2. **Family Status Broken** ‚Üí Now working perfectly on Step 2
3. **Wrong Server Architecture** ‚Üí Migrated to unified monorepo
4. **Dev/Prod Mismatch** ‚Üí Now synchronized using same codebase

### Architecture Change:
- **Before:** server/server-db.js (legacy, hardcoded fixes)
- **After:** packages/server/src/server.js (monorepo, unified)

## üîß RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Immediate (None Required):
- System is fully operational - no immediate actions needed

### Next Sprint (Low Priority):
1. Update Cities API test assertions
2. Remove deprecated Locales endpoint references
3. Add visual regression testing
4. Implement 6-hour automated QA runs
