## ðŸ“¸ ENHANCED SCREENSHOT CONFIGURATION & REPORTING

### QA Server Solution for Screenshot Display

**ISSUE SOLVED:** Browser security restrictions prevent `file://` URLs from displaying screenshots in HTML reports.

**SOLUTION:** HTTP server that provides secure access to test screenshots and reports.

#### Quick Setup Instructions

```bash
# 1. Start the QA Server (runs on port 3002)
npm run qa:server

# 2. Generate credit calculator report with HTTP screenshot URLs  
npm run qa:generate-credit

# 3. Open the generated HTML report - screenshots will display properly!
```

#### Technical Implementation

The enhanced screenshot configuration includes:

- **Automatic Server Detection**: Report generator checks if QA server is running
- **Dual URL Support**: Uses HTTP URLs when server available, falls back to file:// URLs
- **Multi-Source Screenshots**: Discovers both Cypress and Playwright screenshots
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Clear instructions when screenshots fail to load
- **Performance Optimization**: 1-hour caching for images, no-cache for HTML reports

#### Screenshot Discovery Patterns

The system automatically discovers screenshots matching these patterns:
- `*credit*` - General credit calculator screenshots
- `*calculate-credit*` - Specific calculate credit flow screenshots  
- `*credit-calculator*` - Credit calculator component screenshots
- `*dti-*` - Debt-to-income ratio calculation screenshots
- `*employment-*` - Employment validation screenshots

#### Report Generation Commands

```bash
# Credit calculator comprehensive report
npm run qa:generate-credit

# Start QA server for better screenshot display
npm run qa:server

# Generate refinance report (for comparison)
npm run qa:generate-refinance

# Access server dashboard  
open http://localhost:3002
```

#### Server API Endpoints

- `GET /screenshots/cypress/{path}` - Cypress test screenshots
- `GET /screenshots/playwright/{path}` - Playwright test screenshots  
- `GET /reports/{path}` - HTML QA reports
- `GET /api/screenshots` - Screenshot discovery API
- `GET /health` - Server health check

**PRO TIP:** Always start the QA server before generating reports for optimal screenshot display.
