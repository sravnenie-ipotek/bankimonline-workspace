# üéØ BULLETPROOF GIT FLOW - Developer Guide

**BankiMonline Banking Application - Complete Development Workflow**

> **Status**: ‚úÖ BULLETPROOF - Industry standard Git flow with automated deployments  
> **Last Updated**: 24.08.2005
> **System**: Bulletproof self-healing deployment system with 5-point validation  

## üìã COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### **Step 1: Feature Development**
```bash
# Start from develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch for your work
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Do your development work
# ... make changes, commit as needed ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement your feature"
```

### **Step 2: Merge to Develop (Deploy to TEST)**
```bash
# When feature is ready, merge to develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop  # Get latest changes
git merge feature/your-feature-name

# Push to develop = AUTOMATIC TEST DEPLOYMENT
git push origin develop
```

**üß™ THIS TRIGGERS**: Automatic deployment to **TEST server** (45.83.42.74 - dev2.bankimonline.com)

### **Step 3: Test on TEST Environment**
- Visit: https://dev2.bankimonline.com
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Verify all banking features work
- Check version chip updated

### **Step 4: Deploy to Production**
```bash
# When testing is complete, merge develop to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main  # Get latest
git merge develop

# Push to main = AUTOMATIC PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT  
git push origin main
```

**üöÄ THIS TRIGGERS**: Automatic deployment to **PRODUCTION server** (185.253.72.80 - bankimonline.com)

## üõ°Ô∏è BULLETPROOF SYSTEM AUTOMATED ACTIONS

### **On `develop` push** (TEST deployment):
1. ‚úÖ Build frontend and backend
2. ‚úÖ Run 5-point health validation
3. ‚úÖ Deploy to TEST server with blue-green
4. ‚úÖ Activate self-healing monitoring
5. ‚úÖ Update version chip
6. ‚úÖ Send deployment report

### **On `main` push** (PROD deployment):  
1. ‚úÖ Build production-optimized code
2. ‚úÖ Deploy to PRODUCTION server with blue-green
3. ‚úÖ Run comprehensive banking validation
4. ‚úÖ Activate enhanced self-healing monitoring
5. ‚úÖ Verify all banking features operational
6. ‚úÖ Generate production deployment report

## üö® BRANCH RULES & FLOW

### **‚úÖ CORRECT Industry Standard Flow:**
```
feature/my-feature ‚Üí develop ‚Üí main
       ‚Üì              ‚Üì        ‚Üì
    (local)        (TEST)   (PROD)
```

**Branch Mapping:**
- **`develop` branch** ‚Üí TEST server (45.83.42.74 - dev2.bankimonline.com)
- **`main` branch** ‚Üí PRODUCTION server (185.253.72.80 - bankimonline.com)
- **`feature/*` branches** ‚Üí Local development only

### **‚ùå NEVER Do This:**
- Don't push directly to `main` without testing on `develop` first
- Don't use the old `production` branch (it's deprecated)
- Don't deploy feature branches directly
- Don't skip the TEST environment

## üîÑ TYPICAL DAILY WORKFLOW
