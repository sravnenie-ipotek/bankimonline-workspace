#### 1. Citizenship Dropdown ✅ FIXED
- **Original Issue**: "conditional state (dropdown after clicking Yes) clicked yes! then dropdown appears with 'בחר אזרחות' (Select Citizenship) placeholder but the drop down have ne values!!"

#### 3. CRITICAL: 27 Empty APIs ✅ FIXED
- **Original Issue**: 75% of dropdown APIs returning empty responses

- **Multi-language support**: English, Hebrew, Russian translations
- **Dropdown types**: Property ownership, loan periods, purposes, citizenships, education, family status, income sources, financial obligations

#### Component Fixes

- **MultiSelect.tsx**: Verified proper prop interface usage

#### API Infrastructure
- All `/api/dropdowns/{screen}/{language}` endpoints working
- Comprehensive content management system integration
- Proper fallback handling and error recovery

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT UPDATE - ONE MORE ISSUE FOUND AND FIXED

#### Mortgage Step 3 Obligations Dropdown Issue ✅ FIXED
- **Issue Found**: Despite API returning data correctly, the obligations dropdown in mortgage step 3 was showing empty
- **Root Cause**: Component mismatch - API returns `mortgage_step3_obligations` but component was looking for `mortgage_step3_debt_types`
- **Solution**: Updated Obligation.tsx component to use correct field name 'obligations' instead of 'debt_types'
- **File Fixed**: `/mainapp/src/pages/Services/components/Obligation/Obligation.tsx`

This explains why automation tests passed (they checked API responses) but UI wasn't working (component used wrong field).
