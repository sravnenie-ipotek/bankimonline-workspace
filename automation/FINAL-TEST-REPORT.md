data-testid="when-needed-dropdown"
data-testid="property-type-dropdown"
data-testid="first-home-dropdown"
data-testid="initial-fee-input"
data-testid="property-price-input"
```

## 🔍 IDENTIFIED ISSUES

### 1. Test Timeouts
- **Issue**: Complex 4-step tests timeout at 15 seconds
- **Cause**: You requested NOT to increase timeout
- **Impact**: Full flows cannot complete
- **Solution**: Would need timeout increase (but you said no)

### 2. Missing Data-TestIds
- **Issue**: Not all form elements have data-testid
- **Cause**: Only critical ones were added
- **Impact**: Tests fall back to other selectors
- **Solution**: Add more data-testid attributes as needed

### 3. Element Selection Timing
- **Issue**: Some dropdowns take time to load
- **Cause**: API data fetching delays
- **Impact**: Tests may fail intermittently
- **Solution**: Add proper wait conditions

---

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING

### Fully Functional:
1. **Percy Visual Testing** - Capturing snapshots successfully
2. **Language Detection** - Can switch between languages
3. **Simple Tests** - Basic connectivity tests pass
4. **Custom Commands** - All working (switchToEnglish, clickNext, login)
5. **Data-TestId Selection** - Working where implemented
6. **Screenshot Capture** - Both Percy and Cypress screenshots work

### Partially Working:
1. **4-Step Flows** - Start but timeout (15s limit)
2. **Dropdown Selection** - Works with fallback strategies
3. **Authentication Flow** - Mock auth works

---

## 📝 RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Full Success:
1. **Increase Timeout** - Need >15 seconds for complex flows (you said no)
2. **Add More Data-TestIds** - Improve element selection reliability
3. **API Mocking** - Speed up tests with mocked responses
4. **Parallel Execution** - Run tests concurrently

### Next Steps:
1. Review Percy snapshots at the dashboard
2. Add data-testid to remaining form elements
3. Consider allowing timeout increase for complex tests
4. Set up CI/CD integration for automated testing

## 🎯 FINAL STATUS

### Completed as Requested:
- ✅ Language detection/switching - DONE
- ✅ Data-testid attributes - DONE (key elements)
- ✅ Percy token verified - WORKING
- ✅ Timeout NOT increased - AS REQUESTED
- ✅ Percy plugin installed - FUNCTIONAL
