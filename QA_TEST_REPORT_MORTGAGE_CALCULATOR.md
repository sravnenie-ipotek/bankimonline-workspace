# QA Test Report - Mortgage Calculator
**Date**: 2025-07-27
**Tester**: QA Comprehensive Tester Agent
**Application**: BankimOnline Mortgage Calculator

## Executive Summary
This report documents comprehensive testing of the mortgage calculator application with focus on multi-step forms, dropdown validation, and edge cases.

## Test Environment
- **URL**: http://localhost:5173
- **Browser**: Chrome (via Playwright)
- **Language**: Hebrew (default), English, Russian
- **Server Ports**: API (8003), Static Files (3001), Frontend (5173)

## Test Results

### Test ID: 001
**Category**: Language/Localization
**Element**: Language Dropdown
**Test Case**: Language switching functionality and RTL support
**Expected Result**: Language should switch between Hebrew, English, and Russian with proper RTL/LTR layout
**Actual Result**: Application loads in Hebrew by default. Language dropdown visible but experiencing UI overlay issues preventing interaction
**Status**: BLOCKED
**Severity**: High
**Notes**: Font loading timeout errors (5000ms exceeded). Translation keys loading successfully but UI interaction blocked by navigation overlay.

### Test ID: 002
**Category**: Navigation
**Element**: Service Cards Navigation
**Test Case**: Navigate to mortgage calculator from services page
**Expected Result**: Clicking mortgage calculator card should navigate to Step 1 of the form
**Actual Result**: Service cards visible but clicks intercepted by navigation overlay div (_nav_hover_1jo0r_7)
**Status**: FAIL
**Severity**: Critical
**Notes**: UI overlay prevents clicking on service cards. This blocks access to the entire mortgage calculator flow.

### Test ID: 003
**Category**: Routing
**Element**: Direct URL Navigation
**Test Case**: Direct navigation to mortgage calculator steps
**Expected Result**: URLs like /services/calculate-mortgage/step1 should load the correct step
**Actual Result**: 404 error page displayed
**Status**: FAIL
**Severity**: High
**Notes**: Routing configuration appears broken. Attempted URLs:
- /services/calculate-mortgage/step1 → 404
- /services/calculate-mortgage → Loading indefinitely
- /services → Works but cannot proceed due to overlay issue

### Test ID: 004
**Category**: Performance
**Element**: Page Load
**Test Case**: Initial page load performance
**Expected Result**: Page should load within 3 seconds
**Actual Result**: Translation loading completes but UI remains unresponsive. Font loading timeout at 5000ms
**Status**: FAIL
**Severity**: Medium
**Notes**: Console shows successful i18n initialization but font loading blocks UI rendering

### Test ID: 005
**Category**: UI/Accessibility
**Element**: Navigation Overlay
**Test Case**: Navigation menu overlay behavior
**Expected Result**: Navigation overlay should not block main content interaction
**Actual Result**: Invisible overlay div blocks all clicks on main content
**Status**: FAIL
**Severity**: Critical
**Notes**: CSS class _nav_hover_1jo0r_7 creates blocking overlay

## Critical Issues Found

### Issue ID: 001
**Severity**: Critical
**Category**: UI/Navigation
**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/services
2. Attempt to click any service card
3. Click is blocked by navigation overlay

**Expected Behavior**: Service cards should be clickable
**Actual Behavior**: Overlay div intercepts all pointer events
**Environment**: Chrome, macOS
**Screenshot**: Attempted but font loading timeout prevents capture

### Issue ID: 002
**Severity**: High
**Category**: Routing
**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Navigate directly to http://localhost:5173/services/calculate-mortgage/step1
2. Observe 404 error

**Expected Behavior**: Step 1 of mortgage calculator should load
**Actual Behavior**: 404 page displayed
**Environment**: Chrome, macOS

### Issue ID: 003
**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Performance
**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Load any page
2. Wait for fonts to load
3. Timeout occurs at 5000ms

**Expected Behavior**: Fonts should load within reasonable time
**Actual Behavior**: Font loading blocks UI and causes timeouts
**Environment**: Chrome, macOS

### Issue ID: 004
**Severity**: Critical
**Category**: Routing/Module Loading
**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/services
2. Remove navigation overlay blocking (manually via console)
3. Click on "חישוב משכנתא" (Calculate Mortgage) card
4. Observe error

**Expected Behavior**: Should navigate to mortgage calculator step 1
**Actual Behavior**: 
- URL changes to /services/calculate-mortgage/1
- Error: "Failed to fetch dynamically imported module"
- Application crashes with "אירעה שגיאה במערכת" (System error occurred)
**Environment**: Chrome, macOS
**Console Error**: 
```
Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: http://localhost:5173/src/pages/Services/pages/CalculateMortgage/CalculateMortgage.tsx
TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module
```

## Test Coverage Summary

### Completed Tests
- ✅ Language detection and i18n initialization
- ✅ Service page loading
- ✅ Translation key loading verification
- ✅ Navigation overlay removal workaround
- ✅ Service card click functionality (after overlay removal)

### Blocked Tests (Due to Critical Issues)
- ❌ Property ownership dropdown testing
- ❌ Input field boundary testing
- ❌ Slider validation testing
- ❌ Multi-step navigation testing
- ❌ Form validation testing
- ❌ Security vulnerability testing
- ❌ Mobile responsiveness testing

## Recommendations

1. **CRITICAL**: Fix dynamic module import for mortgage calculator route
2. **CRITICAL**: Fix navigation overlay blocking issue immediately
3. **HIGH**: Fix routing configuration for mortgage calculator steps
4. **HIGH**: Verify all lazy-loaded modules are properly configured
5. **MEDIUM**: Optimize font loading to prevent timeouts
6. **MEDIUM**: Add loading indicators for better UX during initialization

## Root Cause Analysis

The mortgage calculator appears to have two critical issues:
1. **UI Blocking**: Navigation overlay with class `_nav_hover_1jo0r_7` blocks all interactions
2. **Module Loading**: The mortgage calculator component is not properly configured for dynamic import, causing route failure

## Next Steps

Cannot proceed with comprehensive testing until critical routing and module loading issues are resolved. Once fixed, will continue with:
- Property ownership dropdown validation
- Input field boundary testing
- Slider behavior based on property ownership
- Multi-step form persistence
- Security and performance testing
