# Architectural Verification Report
Date: 2025-07-22

## Executive Summary

After thorough database analysis, the current implementation status has been verified with the following findings:

### Actual Baseline
- **Mortgage Calculator**: 146 items (100% - this is our baseline, not 123 as previously claimed)
- Distributed across 5 screens: step1, step2, step3, step4, and calculation
- Contains 13 different component types

### Current Implementation Status

| Service | Items | Screens | Completion % | Missing Items |
|---------|-------|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Mortgage Calculator | 146 | 5 | 100.0% | 0 (baseline) |
| Mortgage Refinancing | 36 | 3 | 24.7% | 110 |
| Credit Refinancing | 27 | 4 | 18.5% | 119 |
| Credit Calculator | 17 | 1 | 11.6% | 129 |

### Key Findings

1. **Baseline Discrepancy**: The claimed baseline of 123 items was incorrect. The actual mortgage calculator has 146 items.

2. **Claims Verification**:
   - ✅ Mortgage Refinancing: 36 items (claim verified)
   - ✅ Credit Calculator: 17 items (claim verified)
   - ✅ Credit Refinancing: 27 items (claim verified)

3. **Actual Missing Items** (vs 146 baseline):
   - Mortgage Refinancing: 110 items missing (75.3% incomplete)
   - Credit Calculator: 129 items missing (88.4% incomplete)
   - Credit Refinancing: 119 items missing (81.5% incomplete)

4. **Dropdown Coverage**:
   - Mortgage Refinancing: 17 options across step1
   - Credit Calculator: 17 options in step1
   - Credit Refinancing: 4 dropdown options in step1
   - Note: The claim about "NO DROPDOWNS" for credit refinancing is FALSE - there are 4 dropdown_option items

### Screen-by-Screen Analysis

| Screen | Mortgage Calc | Mortgage Refinance | Credit Calc | Credit Refinance |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|
| Step 1 | 1 | 34 | 17 | 24 |
| Step 2 | 42 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| Step 3 | 42 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| Step 4 | 20 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| Calculation | 41 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

### Missing Component Types

The following component types exist in Mortgage Calculator but are completely missing from refinancing services:
- `text` (18 items)
- `placeholder` (15 items)
- `tooltip` (3 items)
- `unit`, `disclaimer`, `notice`, `hint`, `dropdown` (1 item each)

### Migration Evidence

- Step 4 content exists for refinance_credit_4 (progress_label only)
- Recent migrations were applied for credit refinancing dropdown options
- Migration status shows most items as "migrated"

### Conclusion

The architectural analysis confirms:
1. All three secondary services are severely incomplete (75-88% missing content)
2. The missing content is not just "80-120 items" but actually 110-129 items per service
3. Steps 2-4 are virtually empty for credit services
4. The calculation screen is completely missing from all refinancing services
5. Many essential UI component types are missing entirely

This represents a significant implementation gap that needs to be addressed for feature parity with the mortgage calculator.
