1. **Enhanced Admin Calculation Engine** (`server-db.js`)
   - 4 business path calculators: mortgage, mortgage_refinance, credit, credit_refinance ‚úÖ
   - Real banking approval logic with LTV/DTI/credit scoring ‚úÖ
   - Database-driven configurable standards ‚úÖ
   - Stress testing and age verification ‚úÖ

2. **Customer-Facing System** (`customer-approval-check.html`)
   - Real-time approval probability calculation ‚úÖ
   - Form validation and user feedback ‚úÖ
   - Banking standards integration ‚úÖ

3. **Database Integration** (Railway PostgreSQL)
   - 19+ tables with complete banking schema ‚úÖ
   - Admin-configurable banking standards ‚úÖ
   - Bank-specific override capabilities ‚úÖ

4. **Admin Panel** (`admin.html`)

   - Standards configuration interface ‚úÖ

### ‚ùå WHAT'S MISSING (Critical Implementation Gaps)

**Current Customer Flow Problem:**
```
Customer ‚Üí Fills Form ‚Üí Gets Approval % ‚Üí THE END ‚ùå
```

**Required Complete Flow:**
```
Customer ‚Üí Fills Form ‚Üí Gets Approval % ‚Üí Sees Multiple Bank Options ‚Üí Chooses Bank ‚Üí Submits Application ‚Üí Tracks Status ‚úÖ
```

**Missing Node.js Implementation:**

1. **Multi-Bank Comparison System** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   - Current: Only approval probability calculation
   - Required: Compare rates/terms across all banks simultaneously
   - Missing: `/api/customer/compare-banks` endpoint

2. **Customer Application Workflow** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   - Current: No application submission system
   - Required: Complete loan application processing
   - Missing: `/api/customer/submit-application` endpoint

3. **Application Status Tracking** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Current: No application management
   - Required: Track applications through approval process
   - Missing: `/api/applications/:id/status` endpoint

4. **Bank-Specific Rate Calculation** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Current: Generic approval probability
   - Required: Bank-specific rates based on their standards
   - Missing: Bank override logic integration

5. **Customer-Facing Interface Enhancement** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Current: Basic approval probability display
   - Required: Bank comparison table, application submission forms
   - Missing: Enhanced customer UI components
