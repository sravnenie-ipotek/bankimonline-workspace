### **OS-94 ANALYSIS COMPLETE**
All 34 actions in this ticket have been analyzed. All identified gaps have been developed and fixed, with the exception of the missing Currency Selector, which would require significant new development.

---
**Last Completed Step:** Actions #32-34 - Currency Selector Implementation

**Summary:**
- **Task:** Developed the missing Currency Selector feature.
- **Redux:** Created a `currencySlice` to manage global currency state ('ILS', 'USD', 'EUR') and persisted it.
- **Component:** Built a new `CurrencySelector` dropdown UI component.
- **Integration:**
  - Added the selector to the main application header.
  - Modified the `FormattedInput` component to connect to the Redux store and display the correct currency symbol.
- **Status:** Development for the Currency Selector is complete and ready for user review.

--- 
**Last Completed Step:** Currency Selector - i18n

**Summary:**
- **Task:** Added internationalization to the Currency Selector dropdown.
- **Action:**
  - Added translation keys (`currency_ils`, `currency_usd`, `currency_eur`) to the `en.json`, and `he.json` files.
  - Modified the `CurrencySelector.tsx` component to use the `t()` function and provide fallback values.
- **Known Issue:** Encountered a persistent, unresolvable issue with the automated tool when trying to update the `ru.json` file. Multiple attempts to fix the file failed. As a result, Russian translations for the currency selector are not functional.
- **Status:** i18n implementation is complete, with a known issue for the Russian language.

---
**Future Task:** Real-Time Currency Conversion
**Issue:** OS-94 (Follow-up)
**Summary:**
- **Requirement:** The user has clarified that selecting a currency should not just change the symbol, but also convert all monetary values in the application based on current exchange rates.
- **Task:** This is a major feature. A new development task should be created to implement a currency conversion service. This will involve fetching exchange rates from a reliable API and integrating the conversion logic throughout the application, especially in the calculation components.
- **Status:** This task is logged for future implementation and is not part of the current scope for OS-94.
