Subagents

Copy page

Create and use specialized AI subagents in Claude Code for task-specific workflows and improved context management.

Custom subagents in Claude Code are specialized AI assistants that can be invoked to handle specific types of tasks. They enable more efficient problem-solving by providing task-specific configurations with customized system prompts, tools and a separate context window.

​
What are subagents?
Subagents are pre-configured AI personalities that Claude Code can delegate tasks to. Each subagent:

Has a specific purpose and expertise area
Uses its own context window separate from the main conversation
Can be configured with specific tools it’s allowed to use
Includes a custom system prompt that guides its behavior
When Claude Code encounters a task that matches a subagent’s expertise, it can delegate that task to the specialized subagent, which works independently and returns results.

​
Key benefits
Context preservation
Each subagent operates in its own context, preventing pollution of the main conversation and keeping it focused on high-level objectives.

Specialized expertise
Subagents can be fine-tuned with detailed instructions for specific domains, leading to higher success rates on designated tasks.

Reusability
Once created, subagents can be used across different projects and shared with your team for consistent workflows.

Flexible permissions
Each subagent can have different tool access levels, allowing you to limit powerful tools to specific subagent types.

​
Quick start
To create your first subagent:

1
Open the subagents interface

Run the following command:


Copy
/agents
2
Select 'Create New Agent'

Choose whether to create a project-level or user-level subagent

3
Define the subagent

Recommended: Generate with Claude first, then customize to make it yours
Describe your subagent in detail and when it should be used
Select the tools you want to grant access to (or leave blank to inherit all tools)
The interface shows all available tools, making selection easy
If you’re generating with Claude, you can also edit the system prompt in your own editor by pressing e
4
Save and use

Your subagent is now available! Claude will use it automatically when appropriate, or you can invoke it explicitly:


Copy
> Use the code-reviewer subagent to check my recent changes
​
Subagent configuration
​
File locations
Subagents are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter in two possible locations:

Type	Location	Scope	Priority
Project subagents	.claude/agents/	Available in current project	Highest
User subagents	~/.claude/agents/	Available across all projects	Lower
When subagent names conflict, project-level subagents take precedence over user-level subagents.

​
File format
Each subagent is defined in a Markdown file with this structure:


Copy
---
name: your-sub-agent-name
description: Description of when this subagent should be invoked
tools: tool1, tool2, tool3  # Optional - inherits all tools if omitted
---

Your subagent's system prompt goes here. This can be multiple paragraphs
and should clearly define the subagent's role, capabilities, and approach
to solving problems.

Include specific instructions, best practices, and any constraints
the subagent should follow.
​
Configuration fields
Field	Required	Description
name	Yes	Unique identifier using lowercase letters and hyphens
description	Yes	Natural language description of the subagent’s purpose
tools	No	Comma-separated list of specific tools. If omitted, inherits all tools from the main thread
​
Available tools
Subagents can be granted access to any of Claude Code’s internal tools. See the tools documentation for a complete list of available tools.

Recommended: Use the /agents command to modify tool access - it provides an interactive interface that lists all available tools, including any connected MCP server tools, making it easier to select the ones you need.

You have two options for configuring tools:

Omit the tools field to inherit all tools from the main thread (default), including MCP tools
Specify individual tools as a comma-separated list for more granular control (can be edited manually or via /agents)
MCP Tools: Subagents can access MCP tools from configured MCP servers. When the tools field is omitted, subagents inherit all MCP tools available to the main thread.

​
Managing subagents
​
Using the /agents command (Recommended)
The /agents command provides a comprehensive interface for subagent management:


Copy
/agents
This opens an interactive menu where you can:

View all available subagents (built-in, user, and project)
Create new subagents with guided setup
Edit existing custom subagents, including their tool access
Delete custom subagents
See which subagents are active when duplicates exist
Easily manage tool permissions with a complete list of available tools
​
Direct file management
You can also manage subagents by working directly with their files:


Copy
# Create a project subagent
mkdir -p .claude/agents
echo '---
name: test-runner
description: Use proactively to run tests and fix failures
---

You are a test automation expert. When you see code changes, proactively run the appropriate tests. If tests fail, analyze the failures and fix them while preserving the original test intent.' > .claude/agents/test-runner.md

# Create a user subagent
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
# ... create subagent file
​
Using subagents effectively
​
Automatic delegation
Claude Code proactively delegates tasks based on:

The task description in your request
The description field in subagent configurations
Current context and available tools
To encourage more proactive subagent use, include phrases like “use PROACTIVELY” or “MUST BE USED” in your description field.

​
Explicit invocation
Request a specific subagent by mentioning it in your command:


Copy
> Use the test-runner subagent to fix failing tests
> Have the code-reviewer subagent look at my recent changes
> Ask the debugger subagent to investigate this error
​

​
Best practices
Start with Claude-generated agents: We highly recommend generating your initial subagent with Claude and then iterating on it to make it personally yours. This approach gives you the best results - a solid foundation that you can customize to your specific needs.

Design focused subagents: Create subagents with single, clear responsibilities rather than trying to make one subagent do everything. This improves performance and makes subagents more predictable.

Write detailed prompts: Include specific instructions, examples, and constraints in your system prompts. The more guidance you provide, the better the subagent will perform.

Limit tool access: Only grant tools that are necessary for the subagent’s purpose. This improves security and helps the subagent focus on relevant actions.

Version control: Check project subagents into version control so your team can benefit from and improve them collaboratively.

​
Advanced usage
​
Chaining subagents
For complex workflows, you can chain multiple subagents:


Copy
> First use the code-analyzer subagent to find performance issues, then use the optimizer subagent to fix them
​
Dynamic subagent selection
Claude Code intelligently selects subagents based on context. Make your description fields specific and action-oriented for best results.

​
Performance considerations
Context efficiency: Agents help preserve main context, enabling longer overall sessions
Latency: Subagents start off with a clean slate each time they are invoked and may add latency as they gather context that they require to do their job effectively.
