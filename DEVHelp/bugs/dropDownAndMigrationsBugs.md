2. ‚ö†Ô∏è NUMERIC NAMING VIOLATIONS (Severity: HIGH) - PARTIALLY FIXED

  Violation: Dropdowns using numeric naming (option_1) instead of descriptive names

  Status: PARTIALLY FIXED - Initial migration completed on 2025-07-30
  
  ‚úÖ COMPLETED:
  - Created migration script: migrations/fix_numeric_dropdown_naming.sql
  - Executed migration: 11 dropdown options updated successfully
  - Fixed naming patterns for income sources and education levels
  
  ‚ùå REMAINING ISSUES:
  - 185 numeric patterns still exist in database
  - Multiple screens still have numeric naming violations
  
  üìä Remaining Numeric Patterns by Screen:
  - mortgage_calculation: 71 patterns (e.g., app.mortgage.form.calculate_mortgage_first_options_1)
  - mortgage_step2: 22 patterns
  - refinance_credit_3: 19 patterns  
  - mortgage_step3: 19 patterns
  - refinance_step1: 17 patterns
  - mortgage_step1: 14 patterns
  - refinance_mortgage_1: 10 patterns
  - refinance_credit_1: 4 patterns
  - mortgage_step4: 4 patterns
  - refinance_credit_2: 3 patterns
  - refinance_mortgage_2: 2 patterns
  
  üîß NEXT STEPS:
  1. Create comprehensive migration for remaining screens
  2. Update frontend components using: node migrations/update-frontend-dropdown-values.js
  3. Verify all numeric patterns are converted to descriptive names

  3. ‚ùå MISSING TRANSLATIONS (Severity: HIGH)

  Violation: 7 screens have dropdown containers without ANY translations

  Affected screens:
  - cooperation
  - mortgage_step3
  - mortgage_step4
  - refinance_step1
  - refinance_step2
  - refinance_step3
  - refinance_step4

  4. ‚ùå NO DROPDOWN DATA FETCHING (Severity: CRITICAL)

  Violation: No component actually fetches dropdown structure from database

  Current pattern:
  - Components only use getContent() for labels
  - Options are hardcoded in arrays
  - No API calls to fetch dropdown options

  5. ‚ùå MIXED COMPONENT IMPLEMENTATIONS (Severity: MEDIUM)

  Violation: Some dropdowns bypass the DropdownMenu component entirely

  Example: PropertyOwnership component doesn't follow standard patterns

  6. ‚ùå MISSING DROPDOWN CONTAINERS (Severity: HIGH)

  Violation: Database should have component_type = "dropdown" for main dropdown fields
  
  Current State:
  - Found 98 dropdown containers in database
  - But many are not properly linked to their options
  - No clear parent-child relationship between dropdowns and options
  
  Required Pattern (per dropDownsInDBLogic):
  - Main dropdown: component_type = "dropdown" 
  - Options: component_type = "option"
  - Placeholder: component_type = "placeholder"
  - Label: component_type = "label"

  7. ‚ùå INCONSISTENT CATEGORIES (Severity: MEDIUM)

  Violation: Categories are not consistently applied
  
  Found Issues:
  - Some options have category = "options" instead of "form"
  - Many content items have NULL categories
  - Mixed categories for related content (e.g., bank options have different categories)
  
  Required: All form-related dropdowns should use category = "form"

  üìä IMPACT SUMMARY

  | Area                    | Compliance | Impact                          |
  |-------------------------|------------|---------------------------------|
  | Database Structure      | ‚ö†Ô∏è 65%     | Schema exists but violations    |
  | Frontend Implementation | ‚ùå 10%     | Critical - hardcoded everywhere |
  | Naming Conventions      | ‚ö†Ô∏è 25%     | 185 numeric patterns remain     |
  | Translation Coverage    | ‚ö†Ô∏è 75%     | 7 screens missing translations  |
  | API Integration         | ‚ùå 45%     | Not using database content      |
  | Component Types         | ‚úÖ 90%     | Standardized on "option" type   |
  | Categories              | ‚ö†Ô∏è 60%     | Inconsistent category usage     |

  üîß REQUIRED FIXES

  Immediate (Block Release):

  1. Create useDropdownData hook to fetch from database
  2. Fix CreditData.tsx bank dropdown as proof of concept  
  3. Add missing translations for 7 screens
  4. Complete numeric naming migration for remaining 185 patterns

  High Priority (Next Sprint):

  1. Update all mortgage calculation forms (71 patterns)
  2. Update all refinance forms (48 patterns total)
  3. Fix inconsistent categories - standardize on "form"
  4. Create proper dropdown container relationships

  Medium Priority:

  1. Standardize all dropdown implementations
  2. Remove legacy translation fallbacks
  3. Add validation tests
  4. Verify component_type consistency
  5. Add missing placeholders and labels

  The current implementation violates the core principle that dropdowns should be database-driven,
  making content management impossible without code changes. Additionally, the remaining numeric
  naming patterns violate the descriptive naming requirement from dropDownsInDBLogic rules.
