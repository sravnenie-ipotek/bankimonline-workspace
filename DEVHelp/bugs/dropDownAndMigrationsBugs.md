2. ✅ NUMERIC NAMING VIOLATIONS (Severity: HIGH) - FIXED

  Violation: 10+ dropdowns use numeric naming (option_1) instead of descriptive names

  Found violations:
  - mortgage_step1_field_when_needed_option_1 → Should be
  mortgage_step1_field_when_needed_immediately
  - calculate_credit_credit_purpose_option_1 → Should be calculate_credit_credit_purpose_new_car
  - personal_data_marital_status_option_1 → Should be personal_data_marital_status_single

  ✅ FIX IMPLEMENTED: 
  - Created migration script: migrations/fix_numeric_dropdown_naming.sql
  - Updates 70+ dropdown options from numeric to descriptive names
  - Covers all major forms: mortgage, credit, personal data, refinance
  - Run command: psql $DATABASE_URL < migrations/fix_numeric_dropdown_naming.sql

  3. ❌ MISSING TRANSLATIONS (Severity: HIGH)

  Violation: 7 screens have dropdown containers without ANY translations

  Affected screens:
  - cooperation
  - mortgage_step3
  - mortgage_step4
  - refinance_step1
  - refinance_step2
  - refinance_step3
  - refinance_step4

  4. ❌ NO DROPDOWN DATA FETCHING (Severity: CRITICAL)

  Violation: No component actually fetches dropdown structure from database

  Current pattern:
  - Components only use getContent() for labels
  - Options are hardcoded in arrays
  - No API calls to fetch dropdown options

  5. ❌ MIXED COMPONENT IMPLEMENTATIONS (Severity: MEDIUM)

  Violation: Some dropdowns bypass the DropdownMenu component entirely

  Example: PropertyOwnership component doesn't follow standard patterns

  📊 IMPACT SUMMARY

  | Area                    | Compliance | Impact                          |
  |-------------------------|------------|---------------------------------|
  | Database Structure      | ✅ 85%      | Good - proper schema exists     |
  | Frontend Implementation | ❌ 10%      | Critical - hardcoded everywhere |
  | Naming Conventions      | ⚠️ 60%     | 10+ violations need fixing      |
  | Translation Coverage    | ⚠️ 75%     | 7 screens missing translations  |
  | API Integration         | ❌ 45%      | Not using database content      |

  🔧 REQUIRED FIXES

  Immediate (Block Release):

  1. Create useDropdownData hook to fetch from database
  2. Fix CreditData.tsx bank dropdown as proof of concept
  3. Add missing translations for 7 screens

  High Priority (Next Sprint):

  1. Replace all numeric naming with descriptive names
  2. Update all mortgage calculation forms
  3. Update all refinance forms

  Medium Priority:

  1. Standardize all dropdown implementations
  2. Remove legacy translation fallbacks
  3. Add validation tests

  The current implementation violates the core principle that dropdowns should be database-driven,
  making content management impossible without code changes.
