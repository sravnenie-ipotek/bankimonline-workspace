2. ‚úÖ NUMERIC NAMING VIOLATIONS (Severity: HIGH) - FIXED

  Violation: Dropdowns using numeric naming (option_1) instead of descriptive names

  Status: FULLY FIXED - Comprehensive migration completed on 2025-07-30
  
  ‚úÖ COMPLETED:
  - Created initial migration: migrations/fix_numeric_dropdown_naming.sql
  - Created comprehensive migration: migrations/fix-all-numeric-patterns-complete.sql
  - Executed both migrations successfully
  - Fixed ALL 192 numeric patterns in database
  - 0 numeric patterns remaining
  
  üìä Migration Results:
  - Total patterns fixed: 192
  - Descriptive patterns now: 303
  - All screens now use descriptive naming
  
  ‚ú® Examples of New Naming:
  - app.mortgage.form.calculate_mortgage_property_ownership_option_1 ‚Üí app.mortgage.form.calculate_mortgage_property_ownership_i_no_own_any_property
  - mortgage_calculation.field.education_option_5 ‚Üí mortgage_calculation.field.education_bachelors
  - mortgage_calculation.field.debt_types_option_2 ‚Üí mortgage_calculation.field.debt_types_bank_loan
  
  üîß NEXT STEPS:
  1. Update frontend components using: node migrations/update-frontend-dropdown-values.js
  2. Test all forms to ensure dropdowns work with new naming
  3. Update any hardcoded references in the codebase

  3. ‚ùå MISSING TRANSLATIONS (Severity: HIGH)

  Violation: 7 screens have dropdown containers without ANY translations

  Affected screens:
  - cooperation
  - mortgage_step3
  - mortgage_step4
  - refinance_step1
  - refinance_step2
  - refinance_step3
  - refinance_step4

  4. ‚ùå NO DROPDOWN DATA FETCHING (Severity: CRITICAL)

  Violation: No component actually fetches dropdown structure from database

  Current pattern:
  - Components only use getContent() for labels
  - Options are hardcoded in arrays
  - No API calls to fetch dropdown options

  5. ‚ùå MIXED COMPONENT IMPLEMENTATIONS (Severity: MEDIUM)

  Violation: Some dropdowns bypass the DropdownMenu component entirely

  Example: PropertyOwnership component doesn't follow standard patterns

  6. ‚ùå MISSING DROPDOWN CONTAINERS (Severity: HIGH)

  Violation: Database should have component_type = "dropdown" for main dropdown fields
  
  Current State:
  - Found 98 dropdown containers in database
  - But many are not properly linked to their options
  - No clear parent-child relationship between dropdowns and options
  
  Required Pattern (per dropDownsInDBLogic):
  - Main dropdown: component_type = "dropdown" 
  - Options: component_type = "option"
  - Placeholder: component_type = "placeholder"
  - Label: component_type = "label"

  7. ‚ùå INCONSISTENT CATEGORIES (Severity: MEDIUM)

  Violation: Categories are not consistently applied
  
  Found Issues:
  - Some options have category = "options" instead of "form"
  - Many content items have NULL categories
  - Mixed categories for related content (e.g., bank options have different categories)
  
  Required: All form-related dropdowns should use category = "form"

  üìä IMPACT SUMMARY

  | Area                    | Compliance | Impact                          |
  |-------------------------|------------|---------------------------------|
  | Database Structure      | ‚ö†Ô∏è 65%     | Schema exists but violations    |
  | Frontend Implementation | ‚ùå 10%     | Critical - hardcoded everywhere |
  | Naming Conventions      | ‚úÖ 100%    | All numeric patterns fixed      |
  | Translation Coverage    | ‚ö†Ô∏è 75%     | 7 screens missing translations  |
  | API Integration         | ‚ùå 45%     | Not using database content      |
  | Component Types         | ‚úÖ 90%     | Standardized on "option" type   |
  | Categories              | ‚ö†Ô∏è 60%     | Inconsistent category usage     |

  üîß REQUIRED FIXES

  Immediate (Block Release):

  1. Create useDropdownData hook to fetch from database
  2. Fix CreditData.tsx bank dropdown as proof of concept  
  3. Add missing translations for 7 screens
  4. Complete numeric naming migration for remaining 185 patterns

  High Priority (Next Sprint):

  1. Update all mortgage calculation forms (71 patterns)
  2. Update all refinance forms (48 patterns total)
  3. Fix inconsistent categories - standardize on "form"
  4. Create proper dropdown container relationships

  Medium Priority:

  1. Standardize all dropdown implementations
  2. Remove legacy translation fallbacks
  3. Add validation tests
  4. Verify component_type consistency
  5. Add missing placeholders and labels

  The current implementation violates the core principle that dropdowns should be database-driven,
  making content management impossible without code changes. Additionally, the remaining numeric
  naming patterns violate the descriptive naming requirement from dropDownsInDBLogic rules.
