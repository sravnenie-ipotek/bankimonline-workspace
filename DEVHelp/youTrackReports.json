For a detailed, step-by-step history of the work, refer to 'youTrackReports_log.txt'.\\n\\n## AI Assistant Workflow\\n\\n1.  **Select an Issue**: Begin with a specific YouTrack issue ID. If the issue is not found, it may be a sub-task. Confirm with the user if there is a parent issue and attempt to locate the sub-task there.\\n\\n2.  **Sequential Analysis**: Analyze the issue description sequentially, item by item. For each point, compare the specified requirements (text, functionality, business logic) against the current codebase.\\n\\n3.  **Handle Figma URLs**: When a Figma URL is provided in a YouTrack ticket:\\n    a. Use direct API access to analyze the design. Do not ask the user to open the design on their desktop.\\n    b. To ensure accuracy, confirm which design is being analyzed, for instance by presenting a preview image from the URL.\\n\\n4.  **Analyze Design**: Perform a detailed 'Implementation Gap Analysis' by comparing the visual design and its components against the code.\\n\\n5.  **Propose & Develop**: If gaps are found, **propose a clear, step-by-step development plan.** This is a critical step to avoid bugs.\\n    - **CRUCIAL**: If the development path is complex or could cause regressions, **ASK THE USER for guidance or clarification before writing any code.** Prioritize stability.\\n    - Once the plan is approved, proceed with the code changes.\\n\\n6.  **Log Progress**: After each significant action (analysis block, development task), update the `youTrackReports_log.txt` file with a summary of what was done and the next step.\\n\\n7.  **Mark for Confirmation**: Once all points for an issue are addressed, update its entry in this file (`youTrackReports.json`) with a `status` of `pending_confirmation` and a summary of the work.\\n\\n8.  **Final Confirmation**: The user will give the final 'ok'. Only then, update the status to `done`.\\n\\n9.  **Repeat**: Move to the next issue.",
