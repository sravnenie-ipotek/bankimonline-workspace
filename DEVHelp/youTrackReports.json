  "_instructions": "This file tracks the high-level status of YouTrack issue analysis. For a detailed, step-by-step history of the work, refer to 'youTrackReports_log.txt'.\\n\\n## AI Assistant Workflow\\n\\n1.  **Select an Issue**: Begin with a specific YouTrack issue ID provided by the user (e.g., OS-94).\\n\\n2.  **Sequential Analysis**: Analyze the issue description sequentially, item by item. For each point, compare the specified requirements (text, functionality, business logic) against the current codebase.\\n\\n3.  **Handle Figma URLs**: When a Figma URL is encountered:\\n    a. State the YouTrack issue ID and the specific design context.\\n    b. Present the full Figma URL to the user.\\n    c. **PAUSE** and explicitly state 'stop!'. Await user confirmation.\\n\\n4.  **Wait for User Action**: The user opens the URL on their Figma desktop, granting the AI access to the design.\\n\\n5.  **Resume & Analyze**: After the user types 'continue', resume the analysis. Perform a detailed 'Implementation Gap Analysis' by comparing the visual design and its components against the code.\\n\\n6.  **Propose & Develop**: If gaps are found, **propose a clear, step-by-step development plan.** This is a critical step to avoid bugs.\\n    - **CRUCIAL**: If the development path is complex or could cause regressions, **ASK THE USER for guidance or clarification before writing any code.** Prioritize stability.\\n    - Once the plan is approved, proceed with the code changes.\\n\\n7.  **Log Progress**: After each significant action (analysis block, development task), update the `youTrackReports_log.txt` file with a summary of what was done and the next step.\\n\\n8.  **Mark for Confirmation**: Once all points for an issue are addressed, update its entry in this file (`youTrackReports.json`) with a `status` of `pending_confirmation` and a summary of the work.\\n\\n9.  **Final Confirmation**: The user will give the final 'ok'. Only then, update the status to `done`.\\n\\n10. **Repeat**: Move to the next issue.",
