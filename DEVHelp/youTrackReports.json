  "_instructions": "This file tracks the high-level status of YouTrack issue analysis. For a detailed, step-by-step history of the work, refer to 'youTrackReports_log.txt'.\\n\\n## AI Assistant Workflow\\n\\n1.  **Select an Issue**: Begin with a specific YouTrack issue ID. If the issue is not found, it may be a sub-task. Confirm with the user if there is a parent issue and attempt to locate the sub-task there.\\n\\n2.  **Sequential Analysis**: Analyze the issue description sequentially, item by item. For each point, compare the specified requirements (text, functionality, business logic) against the current codebase.\\n\\n3.  **Handle Figma URLs**: When a Figma URL is provided in a YouTrack ticket:\\n    a. Use direct API access to analyze the design. Do not ask the user to open the design on their desktop.\\n    b. To ensure accuracy, confirm which design is being analyzed, for instance by presenting a preview image from the URL.\\n\\n4.  **Analyze Design**: Perform a detailed 'Implementation Gap Analysis' by comparing the visual design and its components against the code.\\n\\n5.  **Propose & Develop**: If gaps are found, **propose a clear, step-by-step development plan.** This is a critical step to avoid bugs.\\n    - **CRUCIAL**: If the development path is complex or could cause regressions, **ASK THE USER for guidance or clarification before writing any code.** Prioritize stability.\\n    - Once the plan is approved, proceed with the code changes.\\n\\n6.  **Log Progress**: After each significant action (analysis block, development task), update the `youTrackReports_log.txt` file with a summary of what was done and the next step.\\n\\n7.  **Mark for Confirmation**: Once all points for an issue are addressed, update its entry in this file (`youTrackReports.json`) with a `status` of `pending_confirmation` and a summary of the work.\\n\\n8.  **Final Status Assignment**: At the end of OS analysis, the status must be set to either:\\n    - `\\\"done\\\"` - All requirements fully implemented and working correctly\\n    - `\\\"❌ not done\\\"` - Issues/gaps/bugs remain that prevent completion\\n\\n9.  **Problem Documentation**: If status is `\\\"❌ not done\\\"`, MUST include a `\\\"what_is_not_done\\\"` node with:\\n    - `\\\"problem_description\\\"`: Clear explanation of what's wrong/missing\\n    - `\\\"specific_issues\\\"`: Array of detailed issues with location, current code, problem, required fix, and impact\\n    - `\\\"files_affected\\\"`: List of files that need changes\\n    - `\\\"business_impact\\\"`: How this affects users/business logic\\n    - `\\\"severity\\\"`: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priority level\\n\\n10. **User Confirmation**: The user will give the final 'ok' for `pending_confirmation` items. Only then, update the status to `done`.\\n\\n11. **Repeat**: Move to the next issue.",
