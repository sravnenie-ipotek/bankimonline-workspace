must add translation to proper language file to @/translations  folder
1. Understand the Context and Purpose
Before translating, analyze the surrounding UI, code comments, business logic, and user flow.
Identify the target audience (e.g., end-users, admin, legal, compliance, etc.).
If the text is part of a legal document, notice, policy, or agreement, recognize the legal intent and implications.
2. Produce Lawyer-Level Translation
Translate using formal, unambiguous legal language. Avoid colloquialisms, contractions, or vague terms.
Replicate the structure and tone of legal documents—prefer clarity, completeness, and precision.
Use jurisdiction-appropriate legal terms (e.g., Israeli law, EU law) if relevant.
3. Stay True to the Source and Avoid Over-Localization
Do not add, omit, or reinterpret information. Translate the meaning as-is, preserving all nuances and obligations.
Maintain any references to laws, articles, or clauses exactly.
4. Check for Contextual Fit
Ensure the translation fits the specific place in the UI or flow (e.g., form field, tooltip, dialog).
Adapt for gender, number, and formality where appropriate (as per the project's language style guide).
5. Preserve Variable Interpolation and Markup
Maintain all code variables/placeholders (e.g., {username}, %date%, {{amount}}) exactly as in the source.
Never break string formatting, HTML tags, or placeholders.
If the source uses ICU message format or similar, preserve it exactly.
6. Legal Consistency and Compliance
Use consistent terminology across all legal texts in the project.
Reference existing project translations for recurring legal terms or phrases to ensure consistency.
Always check if there are approved legal glossaries or translation memory—reuse those terms.
7. Clarity, Brevity, and No Machine-Literal Translation
Avoid word-for-word, machine-like translation. Ensure the output is natural, but legally precise.
If a phrase cannot be translated directly, rewrite it to preserve the legal intent.
8. Testing and QA
Ensure the translation renders correctly in the frontend (no broken formatting, cutoff text, or misaligned placeholders).
Test the translation in all relevant UI components (responsive, different user roles, etc.).
9. Confidentiality and Compliance
Never leak, store, or transmit translation content outside approved systems.
Handle all legal content as confidential.
