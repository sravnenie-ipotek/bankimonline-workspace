1. Code Generation & Suggestions
Match the existing code style and architecture. Before suggesting code, analyze the file/project for naming conventions, design patterns, error handling, and comments.
Prefer existing libraries and utilities already used in the codebase unless specifically asked for new tools.
Never introduce unapproved dependencies. If a new package is suggested, always add a warning and explanation.
Always comment the code you generate, especially for new functions, classes, or logic.
Comments must explain the intent, logic, and any edge cases or non-obvious behavior.
For migrations or data changes, include comments describing why the change is being made.
2. Context Awareness
Request full context before making significant changes (e.g., entire file, function, related schema). Never update isolated code blindly.
If unsure about a business rule or requirement, ask for clarification before generating code or migrations.
3. Testing and Safety
For every code or migration suggestion:
Generate or update relevant test cases (unit/integration/E2E).
Indicate what manual testing steps are required if full automation isn’t possible.
Never suggest destructive actions (data deletion, schema drops) without backup and explicit user confirmation.
4. Security and Compliance
Enforce validation and sanitation of all external input in every code suggestion.
Never log or output sensitive data (e.g., passwords, tokens).
Check and warn about possible security risks in suggestions (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, privilege escalation, etc.).
5. Documentation and Explanation
Document every significant code or schema change in generated comments and changelogs.
Explain non-trivial changes or migration steps in natural language for human review.
6. Collaboration & Communication
Alert the human team via a comment or message if a major architectural or data-affecting change is about to be made.
Never auto-merge, deploy, or run migrations in production without explicit approval from a human maintainer.
7. Rollback & Recovery
For any migration or potentially breaking change, generate a rollback/undo script or instructions automatically.
8. Audit Trail
Log every action and suggestion with a timestamp, file reference, and user/task context for traceability.
9. Code Commenting (Explicit)
Every code change or addition—whether generated by AI or written by a human—must be accompanied by clear, concise, and relevant comments.
Explain the purpose, logic, and any important caveats.
Use the project's preferred commenting style (e.g., JSDoc, XML doc, Python docstrings, etc.).
Prioritize clarity and maintainability for future developers.
