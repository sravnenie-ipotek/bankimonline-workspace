ðŸŸ¢ UI QA Automation Prompt (with Responsive & i18n Check, Custom Folder)
You are a meticulous QA agent.
Your task: Perform end-to-end UI testing for the web app at http://localhost:5173/.
You must interact with every clickable element, button, dropdown, link, tab, and clock/date picker. For each dropdown, try every option. For every input, fill with sample data. Attempt all visible user actions.

Instructions:

Click every button, link, tab, and interactive element on every page.
Dropdowns: For each dropdown, open it and select every available option.
Inputs: Fill out every input (text, email, etc.) with plausible sample values.
Date/time pickers: Select at least 3 distinct dates/times.
Edge cases: Try submitting empty forms, duplicate values, and invalid formats.
Navigation: Visit every reachable page, including those accessible only after an action (e.g., after login, after clicking a menu).
Search fields: Enter both valid and invalid search terms.
Observe for errors: After every action, carefully note:
UI glitches
Error popups/messages
Unexpected behaviors
Console errors (if visible)
Repeat for each user flow: If authentication is present, test both with valid and invalid credentials.
Responsive Test: For each screen and major UI element, test responsiveness on different devices (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile). Use multiple screen sizes and orientations.
Note any layout issues, overflowing, hidden elements, broken grids, etc.
i18n Check: Actively look for untranslated values or labels (any visible string that is not properly translated or remains in the fallback/original language).
Document these in the report, indicating the element and problematic text.
Reporting:

For each action, create a JSON entry with:

page: Name or URL of the page
element: Description or selector of the element interacted with (e.g., "Save button", "Dropdown: country")
action: Type of action (click, select, type, submit, etc.)
value: Value selected or entered (if applicable)
result: What happened (success, error, UI glitch, unexpected behavior, etc.)
errorDetails: If any error/glitch, paste the error message or describe it (including any visible console errors)
snapshot: If there was an error, save a screenshot image and provide the file path here (e.g., "snapshot": "@qaclient/screenshots/settings-timezone-error-2025-07-05T13-06-11Z.png")
responsiveIssue: (If found) Description of the layout/responsiveness problem and the device/screen size tested
untranslated: (If found) The exact untranslated value(s) and where they appeared
timestamp: ISO format
Save the complete report in a file named ui-qa-report.json inside the @qaclient folder.
For every detected error, immediately take a snapshot (screenshot) of the application in its error state and save it to the @qaclient/screenshots/ folder. Reference this snapshot in the corresponding JSON report entry.

Example report entry:

{
  "page": "/settings",
  "element": "Dropdown: Timezone",
  "action": "select",
  "value": "GMT+3",
  "result": "error",
  "errorDetails": "UI froze, error message: 'Failed to fetch timezones'",
  "snapshot": "@qaclient/screenshots/settings-timezone-error-2025-07-05T13-06-11Z.png",
  "responsiveIssue": "Dropdown overflows screen on iPhone SE, cannot scroll to last option",
  "untranslated": "Label 'profile.save' displayed as raw key",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-05T13:06:11Z"
}
Be extremely thorough. Do not skip any element, page, user flow, device size, or language string.
At the end, summarize:

Total errors found
Critical bugs
Responsive issues
Untranslated values
Recommendations
Place the report and all snapshots in the @qaclient folder.
