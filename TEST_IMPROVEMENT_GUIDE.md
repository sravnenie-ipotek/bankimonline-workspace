# Test Improvement Guide for Banking App Team

## 🎯 Philosophy: Progressive Enhancement, Not Perfection

Tests should help you ship better code, not prevent you from shipping at all. This guide provides a pragmatic approach to improving test coverage over time without blocking deployments.

## ✅ Current State (Non-Blocking)

As of now, all tests are **informational only** and will NOT block your deployments:
- ✅ You can push code even if tests fail
- ✅ Deployments will proceed regardless of test results
- ✅ Test failures appear as warnings, not errors
- ✅ Coverage thresholds are recommendations, not requirements

## 📈 Progressive Testing Strategy

### Sprint 1-2: Foundation (Current)
**Coverage Target: 20-30%**
- Focus on critical business logic only
- Test mortgage calculation functions
- Test authentication flows
- Skip UI component tests for now

### Sprint 3-4: Core Features
**Coverage Target: 40-50%**
- Add tests for main user workflows
- Test form validation logic
- Add API endpoint tests
- Test Redux state management

### Sprint 5-6: Stability
**Coverage Target: 60-70%**
- Add integration tests
- Test error handling
- Add edge case coverage
- Test multi-language support

### Sprint 7+: Excellence
**Coverage Target: 80%+**
- Comprehensive component testing
- E2E test coverage
- Performance testing
- Visual regression tests

## 🚀 Quick Wins for Immediate Improvement

### 1. Fix Failing Tests Locally
```bash
# Frontend tests
cd mainapp
npm test                    # Run tests locally
npm test -- -u             # Update snapshots if UI changed
npm test -- --watch        # Run in watch mode for development

# Check what's actually failing
npm test -- --verbose      # See detailed output
```

### 2. Add Simple Tests First
Start with the easiest tests that provide the most value:

```javascript
// Example: Test a calculation function
// mainapp/src/utils/calculations.test.js
describe('Mortgage Calculations', () => {
  test('calculates monthly payment correctly', () => {
    const result = calculateMonthlyPayment(100000, 5, 30);
    expect(result).toBeCloseTo(536.82, 2);
  });
});
```

### 3. Mock External Dependencies
```javascript
// Mock API calls to avoid test failures
jest.mock('@src/services/api', () => ({
  fetchBankOffers: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve({ offers: [] }))
}));
```

## 🔧 Common Test Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot find module" errors
**Solution**: Check your Jest config path mappings
```javascript
// mainapp/jest.config.js
moduleNameMapper: {
  '^@src/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/src/$1',
  '^@components/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/src/components/$1',
}
```

### Issue: Async test timeouts
**Solution**: Increase timeout or use proper async handling
```javascript
test('async operation', async () => {
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(screen.getByText('Loaded')).toBeInTheDocument();
  }, { timeout: 3000 });
});
```

### Issue: Redux state in tests
**Solution**: Use a test wrapper with provider
```javascript
const renderWithRedux = (component, initialState = {}) => {
  const store = createStore(rootReducer, initialState);
  return render(<Provider store={store}>{component}</Provider>);
};
```

## 📊 Understanding Coverage Reports

When you run tests, you'll see coverage metrics:
- **Statements**: % of code lines executed
- **Branches**: % of if/else paths tested
- **Functions**: % of functions called
- **Lines**: % of executable lines tested

**Focus on**: Functions and Branches first (they catch most bugs)

## 🎯 Priority Testing Areas

### High Priority (Test First)
1. **Financial Calculations** - Core business logic
2. **Authentication** - Security critical
3. **Form Validation** - User experience
4. **API Integration** - Data flow

### Medium Priority
1. **Redux Actions/Reducers** - State management
2. **Utility Functions** - Shared logic
3. **Error Boundaries** - Error handling

### Low Priority (Test Later)
1. **UI Components** - Visual elements
2. **Styling** - CSS/layouts
3. **Static Content** - Text/translations

## 💡 Testing Tips & Tricks

### 1. Use Test IDs for Reliable Selection
```jsx
<button data-testid="submit-button">Submit</button>
```
```javascript
const button = screen.getByTestId('submit-button');
```

### 2. Test User Behavior, Not Implementation
❌ Bad: Testing state changes
✅ Good: Testing what user sees/does

### 3. Keep Tests Simple and Focused
One test should test one thing. If it fails, you should know exactly what broke.

### 4. Use Descriptive Test Names
```javascript
// ❌ Bad
test('test1', () => {});

// ✅ Good
test('should display error when loan amount exceeds maximum', () => {});
```

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement Process

### Weekly Team Practices
1. **Test Review**: 15-min weekly review of test failures
2. **Pair Testing**: Write tests together for complex features
3. **Test Debt Tracking**: Keep a list of areas needing tests

### Monthly Goals
- Increase coverage by 5-10% each month
- Fix all failing tests from previous month
- Add tests for any production bugs found

## 🚨 When to Actually Fix Tests

Fix tests immediately when:
1. They reveal actual bugs in your code
2. They're blocking local development
3. You're modifying the tested code anyway
4. The fix is trivial (< 5 minutes)

Defer test fixes when:
1. You're under deadline pressure
2. The failing test is for deprecated code
3. The test needs major refactoring
4. It's a flaky test that randomly fails

## 🎉 Remember

- **Tests are a tool, not a goal** - They should help you, not hinder you
- **Progress over perfection** - 50% coverage that runs is better than 95% that blocks
- **Learn from failures** - Each test failure is a learning opportunity
- **Celebrate improvements** - Every new test makes the codebase better
